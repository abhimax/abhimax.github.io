Youâ€™ve probably worked with a **UI library** before whether itâ€™s a set of buttons, forms, modals, or grids that you can quickly drop into your projects. Weâ€™re all familiar with these pre-built, reusable components that save time and keep things consistent. But in this article, we wonâ€™t dive deep into definitions. Instead, letâ€™s talk about **why building your own custom UI library** is often the best choice.

With nearly a decade of experience developing **React component libraries**, Iâ€™ve seen the real-world challenges and benefits firsthand. Iâ€™ll be sharing practical insights based on my journey, showing how to streamline the development process and avoid the common pitfalls

# Why Do We Need Our Own Custom UI Library?

With a multitude of existing UI libraries like MUI, Ant Design, Chakra, and Radix, the question arises: **Why build your own?** While these libraries offer a range of features, creating a **custom UI library** can provide several key advantages that off-the-shelf solutions canâ€™t match.

## ðŸŸ£ **Design-to-Development Gaps**

The handoff from design to development often creates gaps in communication and execution. Design specifications can be misinterpreted, leading to inconsistencies in the final product.

## ðŸŸ£ **Lack of Tooling**

Without the right tools, designers and developers struggle to sync their work. Manual translation from design to code can cause visual drift, where the final product doesnâ€™t accurately reflect the design intention.

## ðŸŸ£ Inefficient Handoff and Disconnection

When design, development, and product teams work **separately** without enough communication, it leads to poor handoffs. Design changes arenâ€™t clearly passed to development, which causes **slower work cycles**, confusion, and teams not being on the same page. This disconnection can result in delays and inconsistencies when building UI components.

## ðŸŸ£ **Misaligned Expectations**

Design and development teams often have different expectations regarding visual elements, component behavior, and integration. Without a clear system and shared understanding, these misalignments can delay projects and result in poor-quality products.

## ðŸŸ£ **Versioning and Backward Compatibility Issues**

When components arenâ€™t managed properly, there can be versioning issues, where updates to the UI library cause backward compatibility problems. This creates friction when trying to maintain multiple versions of an application or system.

# **Problems of the** Traditional Development Processâ€‹

In the traditional development process, design and development teams often work in silos, leading to several challenges in collaboration and efficiency.

![Traditional Development Process](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*8wFteXCwYWJNynzEOZ0u0g.png)

As you can see from the problems outlined above, we can break them down into two main categories

## ðŸŸ£ **Syncing Issues Between the Design Team and the Component Library Development Team**

## ðŸŸ£ **Challenges Between the Component Library Development Team and Consumer (Product) Teams**

The below Table highlights the syncing issues between the **Design Team** and **Component Library Development Team**. It shows how misalignment and manual handoffs slow down development, making the workflow inefficient. Understanding these challenges is key to building a more efficient UI library.

# Our Solution

Now that weâ€™ve identified the challenges, letâ€™s move on to the solution. Developing a UI library from scratch can be a long and complex process. Instead of starting from the ground up, we can leverage an existing **component library**, customizing its components to serve as the **base** for our own. From there, we can build advanced components tailored to our needs.

Selecting the right **base component library** is crucial. Itâ€™s important to align the libraryâ€™s features with our business requirements.

For our project, we selected **Radix UI,** Radix is an open source component library optimized for fast development, easy maintenance, and accessibility. It provids 2 main options.

## [**Radix Theme**](https://www.radix-ui.com/)

Radix Themes is a pre-styled component library that is designed to work out of the box with minimal configuration.

## [**Radix Primitive**](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives)

Radix Primitives is a low-level UI component library with a focus on accessibility, customization and developer experience. You can use these components either as the base layer of your design system, or adopt them incrementally.

For our project, we selected **Radix UI Themes**, and here are the key factors that influenced our choice.

## Why We Chose Radix UI Themes

**Customizability -** _Easily adaptable to fit our design needs._

**Community-driven Figma File -** _Radix offers a customizable Figma file, allowing our design team to easily create components that align with the UI system while maintaining consistency across our designs._

**Built-In Design Tokens -** _Radix uses CSS variables to represent token values, and the Radix Figma file includes variables that perfectly match those in the library, ensuring seamless synchronization between design and development._

**Scalability -** _Easily scale as the project grows._

**Accessibility First -** _Ensures compliance with accessibility standards._

**Styled and Unstyled Components -** _Flexibility in styling options._

**Seamless Integration with Design Systems -** _Works well with existing systems._

**Integration with Other Libraries -** _Easily integrates with other tools we use._

**Flexibility in Theming -** Allows for quick adjustments to branding.

By selecting Radix, weâ€™ve created a **strong foundation** to build a UI library that meets both our business needs and design goals.

# UI Component Architecture

In this section, Iâ€™ll walk you through the architecture of our demo UI library app, [**_radix-react-ui-lib_**](https://github.com/abhimax/radix-react-ui-lib), and how it demonstrates a complete workflow. Our library is built on a flexible foundation, using pre-styled and customizable components to ensure consistency and ease of development. There are two main types of components in _radix-react-ui-lib_

1. # Primitive Components

## Row

We use Radix UI Theme components as the base for our components, styling them with design tokens. Atomic components like Buttons, Inputs, and Text are imported directly from Radix without modification. We only overwrite Radixâ€™s design tokens with our own generated CSS variables to ensure consistency with our theme.

## **Custom**

Some Radix components require customizations to match Figma designs. We add custom classes while using Radixâ€™s base components, tailoring them to our needs without changing the underlying structure. Examples include customized components like AlertDialog and Tabs.
All primitive components follow Radixâ€™s design system, with pre-styled components. We overwrite Radixâ€™s design tokens with synced Figma tokens, ensuring the designs are updated without altering the component styles.

2. # Extended Components

In any component library, some components arenâ€™t covered out-of-the-box. To fill these gaps, weâ€™ve integrated third-party libraries. For instance, the scheduler component is built using [**_react-big-calendar_**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-big-calendar). These components come with their own styles, so we apply custom classes to make sure they align with our Figma designs. Styling properties like colors, fonts, and spacing are all derived from synced Figma design tokens to maintain consistency.

3. # Icons

Radix provides a separate package for icons, [**_@radix-ui/react-icons_**](https://www.radix-ui.com/icons), where each icon is a React component. We use this in our library, grouping the icons in the same way for easy access.

Below is a diagram explaining the component structure described above.

In this section, we explored the architecture of the [_radix-react-ui-lib_](https://github.com/abhimax/radix-react-ui-lib), focusing on its foundation, primitive and extended components, and the customizations necessary for seamless integration with Figma designs. We also discussed some of the pain points we encountered during development and how we addressed them.

You can explore our source code to get a better understanding of the [_radix-react-ui-lib_](https://github.com/abhimax/radix-react-ui-lib) architecture. Since this post has gotten quite long, Iâ€™ll wrap it up here and dive into the next part, where weâ€™ll discuss how we solved the design-to-development syncing issue. The next section is particularly exciting, as we present a solid solution to bridge the design-dev gap. Stay tuned and happy coding!
